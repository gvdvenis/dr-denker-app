## Architecture Highlights

- **Single-Page Application**: No routing library - uses Vue's reactive state and v-if for dialog management
- **Prop/Emit Pattern**: Components communicate via props and events, not route parameters
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in transitions for dialog opening, cross-fade for image switching
- **Fixed-Height Carousel**: 130px (desktop) / 90px (mobile) with explicit thumbnail sizing (100px / 60px)
- **Panzoom Reinitialization**: Disposes and recreates panzoom instance on image change to handle DOM transitions
